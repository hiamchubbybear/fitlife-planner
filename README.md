# FitLife Planner  **FitLife Planner** is a web application that helps users build and maintain a personalized fitness and nutrition plan.   The system provides tailored workout schedules and meal recommendations based on each user's body metrics, goals, and lifestyle.  This project is developed as a **graduation thesis** and aims to demonstrate the application of modern web technologies (.NET, React, Redis, Kafka) in building a scalable and data-driven health management system.  ### 🌟 Key Features - **Personalized fitness plan** — automatically generates workout routines based on user’s fitness level and goals. - **Smart nutrition planner** — calculates calorie needs (BMR → TDEE → target calories) and creates daily meal suggestions. - **Progress tracking dashboard** — visualize weight, calories, and performance over time. - **Community & motivation** — connect with other users for tips and encouragement (optional module). - **Real-time notifications** — powered by Redis & Kafka for async updates and background processing.  ### 🧱 Tech Stack | Layer | Technology | |-------|-------------| | Frontend | ReactJS (Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS) | | Backend | ASP.NET 8 (C#) RESTful API | | Database | PostgreSQL / MongoDB | | Caching | Redis | | Messaging | Kafka (for event-driven updates) | | Deployment | Docker, Nginx, CI/CD ready |  ### 🎯 Project Goals - Build a **full-stack health management platform** with a focus on modular, scalable architecture. - Apply practical software engineering concepts: authentication, data persistence, caching, and async messaging. - Deliver a clean, modern, and responsive user experience.  ---  > 🚀 *FitLife Planner helps you take control of your health — one plan at a time.*
